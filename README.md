## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

CSS gradient backgrounds. They sound easy but are not easy to implement. I had to use a before attribute, which only partially solved my problem. Please let me know if you guys have a better working solution.
### Continued development

I'll like to focus more on gradient backgrounds and improving the overall feel on the dark theme.
